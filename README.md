# password-generator

## Description
- generates passwords using alerts, prompts, and confirms in javascript
- allows for the user to quickly and easily generate a new, secure password through interacting with a few simple questions
- acknowledges the need for password management and security given how data security breaches are a common occurence, and that thinking of a new password on the spot can be difficult
- allows the exclusion of certain characters so that the user can customize which special characters they prefer or are more likely to remember, or are able to type at the time of creation

- Uses html and css as the foundation for the site and javascript to create the interactive portion
- Uses alerts, prompts, confirms (conditionals? functions? etc -- add as project continues)
